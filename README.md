  # ðŸ”­ DataEng Project: Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake Integration

Welcome to the README for my latest DataOps project! This project leverages powerful tools like Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake to create a robust data pipeline that is both scalable and efficient.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a seamless workflow for data transformation and orchestration using:
- **Airflow:** For orchestrating the workflow of data jobs.
- **dbt (data build tool):** For transforming data in our Snowflake data warehouse.
- **Snowflake:** As our scalable cloud data platform to store and analyze large amounts of data.
